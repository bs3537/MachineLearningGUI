Machine Learning GUI for scikit-learn in Python (PyQt) - Prototype

The goal of this project is to make machine learning more accessible for novice programmers.

This only works for the adult sample data that is provided. This is from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

You will need scikit-learn, matplotlib, and all other dependencies to run it (numpy, scipy, etc.)

Run with 'python main.py'

See the included presentation (.pdf) for some analysis that went into this project.
